Breakout boards for stand-alone capacitive touch sensors. These are the simplest ways to create projects with capacitive touch. No microcontroller is required here - just power with 1.8 to 5.5VDC. When a capacitive load is detected (e.g. a person touches one of the conductive contacts) the corresponding LED lights up and the output pin goes low. 

Format is EagleCAD schematic and board layout
